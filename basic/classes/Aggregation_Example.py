"""
Aggregation follows the Has-A model. This creates a parent-child relationship between two classes, with one class owning the object of another.

So, what makes aggregation unique?

Independent lifetimes #
In aggregation, the lifetime of the owned object does not depend on the lifetime of the owner.

The owner object could get deleted, but the owned object can continue to exist in the program. In aggregation, the parent only contains a reference to the child, which removes the child’s dependency.

Example:
Let’s take the example of people and their country of origin. Each person is associated with a country, but the country can exist without that person.
